X-Station — Design Language (v2)

Visual Direction: Uber × Apple
Quiet. Controlled. Premium.

If a screen feels designed, it’s wrong.
If it feels obvious, it’s right.

1. Brand Feel

Calm

Clear

Confident

Silent

No excitement.
No gamification.
No persuasion.

The UI should get out of the way.

2. Color System (Strict)
Core Colors

Primary: #5b0e00 — actions only

Black: #000000

White: #FFFFFF

Grays (Hierarchy Only)

#111111 — dark surfaces

#222222 — borders / dividers (dark)

#666666 — secondary text

#AAAAAA — tertiary / placeholders

#E5E5E5 — borders (light)

#F5F5F5 — input & surface backgrounds

Rules

No gradients

No decorative color

Color = meaning, not style

Dark mode is pure black, not gray

3. Typography

Font: Inter (system fallback allowed)

Usage Rules

Text is the UI

Fewer sizes, used consistently

Large body text, generous spacing

Core Sizes

Title: 24–30px / SemiBold

Section: 18–20px / Medium

Body: 16px / Regular

Caption: 12–14px / Regular

No decorative fonts.
No compressed text.

4. Spacing & Layout

Screen padding: 20px

Vertical rhythm > visual decoration

One primary action per screen

Complex forms = steps, not pages

If a screen feels dense → split it.

5. Radius & Shape

Default radius: 12px

Inputs & cards: 12px

Buttons: 12px

No pills

No exaggerated rounding

Flat, architectural shapes only.

6. Components (Minimal Set)
Buttons

Primary: solid primary color

Secondary: text or outline only

Height: 52px

Full-width for main actions

No icons unless essential.

Inputs

Height: 52px

Background: #F5F5F5

Border: subtle, visible

Clear focus state

Keyboard must never cover content

Cards

Flat

Border > shadow

Used only to group content, not decorate

Modals

Slide up

Used sparingly

Prefer full screens

Keyboard-safe by default

7. Icons

Line icons only

Monochrome

Support text, never replace it

If text can work alone → remove the icon

8. Motion

Fast: 150ms

Normal: 250ms

Only:

Fade

Slide

No bounce.
No spring.
No delight animations.

Motion should be invisible.

9. Copy

Short

Neutral

Functional

Good

“Check in”

“Session active”

“Membership valid”

Never

Emojis

Marketing tone

Exclamation marks

10. Platform Philosophy

Avoid native alerts & popups

Build custom UI components

No legacy-looking elements

Modern React Native feel only

Final Rule

If a screen feels exciting, it’s wrong.
If it feels calm and inevitable, it’s right.
